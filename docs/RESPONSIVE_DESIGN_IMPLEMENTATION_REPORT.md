### Implementation Pattern
```dart
final screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
final isSmallScreen = screenWidth < 600;
final isMediumScreen = screenWidth >= 600 && screenWidth < 900;
final isLargeScreen = screenWidth >= 900;
```

## 🎨 Responsive Design Features

### 2. Responsive Sizing
- **Icons**: 48px (mobile) → 56px (tablet) → 64px (desktop)
- **Text**: Adaptive font sizes with screen-specific multipliers
- **Buttons**: 48dp (mobile) → 52dp (tablet) → 56dp (desktop)
- **Padding**: 16px (mobile) → 24px (tablet) → 32px (desktop)

### 3. Smart Layout Switching
